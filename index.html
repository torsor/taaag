A central tool in many important modern developments in algebra and
arithmetic geometry has been the influx of ideas from algebraic topology.
In recent years, the way in which topological ideas have been used has
branched in new and interesting ways. This workshop will serve to expose
graduate students and recent PhD's to some recent developments along these
lines with a collection of micro-courses and related talks.

Topological Approaches to Algebra and Arithmetic Geometry (TAAAG) is a 3
day workshop run for graduate students and early career mathematicians, as
a part of the The AGANT (Algebraic Geometry, Algebra and Number Theory)
Research and Training Group at the University of Georgia Mathematics
Department, and funded by NSF grant DMS-1344994.

Organizers: Ben Antieau, Danny Krashen and Kirsten Wickelgren
